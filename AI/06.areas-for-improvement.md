# 🚧 Areas for Improvement – Project Enhancements

This document outlines key areas for improving the functionality, security, and auditability of the platform. These improvements aim to make the system more robust, scalable, and enterprise-ready.

---

## 🔐 1. Advanced Access Control (RBAC)

### 🎯 Objective:
Ensure only authorized users can access sensitive actions or data.

### 🧩 Proposed Roles:
- **Admin:** Full access (manage users, payroll, projects)
- **Manager:** Can create/edit projects, assign tasks
- **Employee:** Can view assigned tasks, mark them as done

### 🔒 Role-Based Permissions:

| Action                      | Admin | Manager | Employee |
|----------------------------|:-----:|:-------:|:--------:|
| View Payroll               | ✅     | ❌       | ❌        |
| Edit Payroll               | ✅     | ❌       | ❌        |
| Add/Delete Project         | ✅     | ✅       | ❌        |
| Add/Delete Employee        | ✅     | ❌       | ❌        |
| Edit Employee Base Salary  | ✅     | ❌       | ❌        |

## 🧾 2. Audit Trail / History Tables

### 🎯 Objective:
Track and log critical actions across the system for accountability and rollback support.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Actions to Log:
- 👤 Employee created, edited, or deleted
- 📁 Project created, edited, or deleted
- 💸 Payroll record generated or modified
- 💰 Salary changes (with timestamp and responsible user)

### 📚 Example Audit Log Entry:
```json
{
  "action": "delete_employee",
  "performed_by": "admin@company.com",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-19T12:45:00Z",
  "metadata": {
    "employee_id": "EMP123",
    "employee_name": "John Doe"
  }
}

## 💰 3. Payroll Logic Enhancements

### 🎯 Objective:
Ensure that payroll records remain consistent and historically accurate, while allowing flexibility for future salary updates.

### 🧠 Current Behavior:
- When a payroll is already **generated** for a future month (e.g., June), and a user changes the base salary now (in May), the June payroll reflects the new salary — **even though it was already generated**.

### ⚠ Problem:
This causes inconsistencies in payroll records that were already generated. For example:
> June’s payroll was generated with a base salary of $3000. In May, someone updates the salary to $3500. Now the June payroll incorrectly reflects $3500.

---

### 🔄 Proposed Rule (Improved Logic):

1. **If payroll is already generated**, and the payroll month is **in the past or current month**,  
   ➤ **Do not apply** any base salary changes.

2. **If payroll is already generated**, and the payroll month is **in the future**,  
   ➤ Apply the updated base salary **only if** the user explicitly re-generates the payroll (with a warning).

3. **If payroll is not yet generated**,  
   ➤ Use the latest base salary during generation.

---

### ✅ Benefits:
- ✅ Protects historical payroll data from accidental edits
- ✅ Ensures real-world consistency (just like HR systems)
- ✅ Reduces potential disputes over salary calculations
- ✅ Allows legitimate forward-looking salary adjustments

---

### 💡 Optional Enhancements:
- Add a toggle for “Lock Generated Payrolls”
- Add a warning if someone updates salary for an employee with a generated payroll in the future
- Enable Admin override with logging for full control
