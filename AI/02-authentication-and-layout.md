# 🔐 Phase 1: Authentication & Layout

## 🎯 Objective

Implement secure, user-friendly authentication using **NextAuth.js**, and set up a consistent UI layout with navigation for authenticated users.


## ✅ Status

This phase is already **completed**.


## 🔍 Observation: Signup Flow UX

### 🧪 Behavior Noticed:
After completing the signup form, the app redirects the user to the login page — requiring them to log in manually.

# AI Reflection

🧵 Prompts Used:
“What’s the best practice for post-signup UX in NextAuth with credentials?”


### 💡 AI Recommendation:
Auto-login users immediately after successful signup, unless email verification is required.

### ✅ Reasoning:
- Auto-login post-signup improves UX.
- The only valid case for *not* auto-logging in is when **email verification is enforced** (which we are not doing at this stage).
- It's a widely accepted UX pattern to log in users automatically after signup in credential-based flows.
